## PRN232 – Final Assignment

## 1. Objective

The objective of this assignment is to design, develop, and deploy a distributed application using the .NET ecosystem. Students are expected to apply the concepts of RESTful API, asynchronous messaging, background processing, inter-service communication, containerization, and cloud-native deployment.

## 2. Functional Requirements

Students are free to choose any application domain (e.g., e-commerce, education, healthcare, logistics, IoT, smart campus, booking, finance, etc.). The solution must include the following components:

## 2.1 REST API Service

Develop at least one ASP.NET Core REST API.•

Follow RESTful design principles and naming conventions.•

Implement CRUD operations for core business entities.•

Apply layered architecture (API – Services – Repository).•

Implement authentication using JWT.•

Support searching, filtering, sorting, and pagination where appropriate.•

## 2.2 Background Job

Implement at least one background processing service.•

The background job should execute scheduled or asynchronous tasks, such as:•

Sending notifications or emails.•

Data synchronization.•

Report generation.•

Data cleanup.•

Inventory updates.•

Other business-related background processes.•

## 2.3 Message Broker

Integrate a message broker to enable asynchronous communication.•

Students may choose one of the following technologies:•

Apache Kafka•

Redis (Pub/Sub or Streams)•

Demonstrate at least one producer and one consumer.•

## 2.4 gRPC Service

Develop an independent service communicating through gRPC.•

Demonstrate interaction between the REST API and the gRPC service.•

Typical use cases include:•

Recommendation service.•

Pricing service.•

AI/ML inference service.•

Inventory service.•

User profile service.•

## 3. Deployment Requirements

The entire system must be deployable using one of the following approaches:

Docker Desktop with Docker Compose.•

A public cloud platform (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, Render, Railway, etc.).•

Deployment must include all required services and demonstrate successful communication among system components.

## 4. Technical Requirements

The project should demonstrate the following technical capabilities:

ASP.NET Core (.NET 8 or later).•

Entity Framework Core.•

SQL Server or another relational database.•

Dependency Injection.•

Configuration management.•

Logging and exception handling.•

JWT Authentication.•

RESTful API design.•

gRPC communication.•

Message Broker integration.•

Background Service.•

Docker containerization.•

## 5. Deliverables

Each team must submit:

Complete source code.•

Database scripts or migrations.•

Dockerfile(s).•

Docker Compose configuration (if applicable).•

API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).•

README.md containing:•

Project description.•

System architecture.•

Technology stack.•

Installation guide.•

Deployment instructions.•

Team member responsibilities.•

## 6. Demonstration

During the final presentation, each team must demonstrate:

System architecture.•

REST API functionality.•

Background job execution.•

Message publishing and consuming.•

gRPC communication.•

Docker or cloud deployment.•

End-to-end business workflow.•

## 8. Notes

Students may work individually or in teams (according to the course policy).•

Application domain is completely open; however, the solution must clearly demonstrate all• required technologies.

Additional features beyond the minimum requirements will be considered as bonus during• evaluation, provided they are well designed and implemented.
